#DOS/65
This is a full-fledged CP/M work-alike for the 6502 developed by Rich Leary.  He has made the software and documentation available for individual (hobbyist) use.  The software is still commercial software, though, so please contact Richard Leary if you wish to distribute the software (see license info below).

## Files:
